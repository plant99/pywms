Experimental WMS with hardcoded parameters. 

Development has stopped in favour of [pygeoapi](https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi)

If you still want to run it,

```
1. clone this repository, cd into it
2. Install [cartopy's dependencies](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html)
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. python pywms/pywms.py
5. open client/client.html with a browser :)
```
